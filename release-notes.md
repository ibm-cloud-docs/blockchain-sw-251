See [Installing patches](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-manage-console#ibp-console-manage-patch) for instructions on how to apply patches to your existing nodes. Patches are cumulative. This means that if multiple patches, for example `1.4.7-0` and `1.4.7-1`, are available for a node, you should always select the latest patch, `1.4.7-1` in this case, wherever possible because it includes the fixes from the previous patches as well.
